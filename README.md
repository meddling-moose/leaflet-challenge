# leaflet-challenge

The data in this set comes from earthquakes.usgs.gov. I chose to filter using the 2.5+ magnitude over the last 7 days filter. Thanks to them for making this information public.

This challenge taught me how to better use Leaflet. I really liked it because the more I figured out, the more it felt like I was conveying information to a viewer. The legend and the color scale for the depth of earthquakes were the hardest parts for me. At first the colors showed up in a black and white scale and the legend not at all, but after some functions, research on circle method fields, and css, I fixed those problems.
